# NRM Python

Python binaries and notebook infrastructure on top of nrm-core.

Currently contains the official nrm daemon implementation, as well as
additional python modules to talk to the NRM from a python application, both
for progress reporting and to implement control methods on top of the NRM.

Relies on other nrm packages.
