NRM-Python Documentation
========================

The following is a guide for the NRM Python API and utilities.

If you know about NRM and are just looking to get it to run on your
application, please visit the :doc:`quickstart <nrm-home:quickstart>` guide.

The :doc:`quickstart <nrm-home:quickstart>` guide describes the use of ``nrm`` and ``nrmd``.
See the `haddock`_ documentation for the shared library API,
and the `notebooks`_ for python upstream client use.
